              <p>We want a quick and easy way to meet new people interested in our personal projects. Be it a garage band, a drone racing team or even to organize an engagement. So we built Team.Port.Ninja* (*name subject to change) A place to showcase your projects and get found by the community.

Yes, you ask. Isn't this like Kickstarter or something? Well we had 48 hours and a lot of fun doing this, besides.. the purpose is not to raise funds but raise the level of teamwork that can be accomplished online.
<br><br>
We will expand this on the future to use geolocation for local results and add personal pages for our members.
